Despite the multitude of text editors out there suitable for writing VHDL code, we would like to recommend the simple yet powerful [gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/) with its code snippet plugin. If you are using a Linux-centric machine you can easily install gedit and its plugins with the command:

```
sudo apt-get install gedit gedit-plugins
```

If you want to see how gedit and ghdl go together for some VHDL development, please have a look at some [tutorials](http://ghdl.free.fr/site/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Tutorials).
