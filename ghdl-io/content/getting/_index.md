## Package managers

Install through the package manager of your choice: apt-get, aptitude, yum, dnf, pacman, chocolatey, brew... (Help us package GHDL for missing or out-of-date platforms!)

## Releases

Download a release tarball and install it manually.

## Building

If you are interested in running GHDL on a different OS not listed here, you can download and compile the GHDL source code available from the download section. For that you will need gcc and gnat.

## Ready-to-use docker images

- Docker:
    - Use a docker container as a replacement for a local installation.
        - Batch
        - Interactive
        - Service and exec
        - X server: gtkwave
    - Play with GHDL in play-with-docker (PWD)
        - shell + nano/vim
        - shell + nano/vim + web file browser
        - shell + web text editor + web file browser
        - shell + [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) + web file browser
        - shell + lightweight web IDE
        - [eclipse/che](https://github.com/eclipse/che/)
            - `docker run --rm -e CHE_PORT=5000 -v /$(pwd)/eclipse_che:/data -v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock eclipse/che start`

NOTE: any of the play-with-docker cases can be executed in any machine with a running docker daemon, let it be the box of a single developer or a server to be shared in a group. However, web service specific issues such as settings DNS, proxies and/or access control are out of the scope of this article.
